This repository contains code snippets and algorithms that I want to save

`npm install portexe-snips`

### Algorithms

1. Get Prime Factors (Of a given integer)

### Data Structures

1. Binary Search Tree
2. Trie

### Sorting

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort

### Helpers

1. Random Number (Between given range)

### More being added constantly

- Note that because I am adding checks throughout the algorithms to throw potential errors, I am decreasing the algorithm's efficiency slightly. In the future it may make sense to only run the checks in a type of "test mode", otherwise ignore the checks in a production environment.
